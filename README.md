## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete **data pipeline** — from **web scraping** raw book data to **extracting insights** using SQL and Python. It includes:

- Scraping book titles, prices, availability, ratings, and categories
- Cleaning and structuring data using Python (Pandas)
- Loading data into a SQLite/PostgreSQL database
- Performing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights
- Visualizing data patterns with Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly
